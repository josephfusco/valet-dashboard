# Valet Dashboard

A [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/valet) site that acts as a dashboard for the other sites it is parked with.

## Install

From within the parked directory,

```sh
git clone git@github.com:josephfusco/valet-dashboard.git
```

The dashboard directory should be named `valet-dashboard`.

Visit [valet-dashboard.dev](http://valet-dashboard.dev), or whatever domain you are using (e.g. [valet-dashboard.app](http://valet-dashboard.app), etc).
